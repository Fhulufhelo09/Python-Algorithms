# Python-Algorithms
Used python algorithms to create  a function that merged two sorted lists into a single list in sorted order. The function compared elements from both lists, one by one, and added the smaller element to the merged list. If one list was exhausted before the other, the remaining elements of the other list were directly appended to the result.
